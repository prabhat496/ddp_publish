## Designing the dryer

Important consideration while building the dryer:

1. It is designed for the small scale farmers - Do you know the typical yield?
2. It is designed to work passively - Due to low cost and lack of electricity connections
3. Should be a resilient design - Protect against wear and tear, should work while damaged, easily repairable
4. It is easily transportable - Why?
   1. Generally these requirements (no electricity, low cost requirements) are in the remote areas 
      1. One possible solution is to make it in parts, where each part is a dryer and assembled it is also one large dryer.
      2. Individual parts are easier to transport and should be made such that it is easy to assemble as well.
