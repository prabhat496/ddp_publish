### This document shows the approach used for coding the iteration function

```matlab
% Matlab code starts

    % All the immuatable required values such as
    
    Length of collector ;
    width;
    slope;
    Air properties;
    material properties;
    
    % Initial values for all the mutable values
    
    density;
    Numbers - Reynolds, Prantl, Rayleigh etc;
    
while(velocity convergence criteria)
    % collector iterations
    
    for(till the segment in collector finishes):
    	
    	while(convergence criterion):
    		[new_values] = collector_iteration[old_values];
    	end
        
        [pressure profile] = pressure_calc[old_values, new_values];
        
   	end
   	
   	collector_data -> external_data_base;
   	
   	% Drying chamber iterations
   	
   	for(till the first tray)
   	
   	    while(convergence criterion):
    		[new_values] = chamber_iteration[old_values];
    	end
        
        [pressure profile] = pressure_calc[old_values, new_values];
        
   	end
   	
   	while(convergence criterion):
   		[new_values] = drying_plate_iteration[old_values];
   	end

   	for(till the second tray)
   	
   	    while(convergence criterion):
    		[new_values] = chamber_iteration[old_values];
    	end
        
        [pressure profile] = pressure_calc[old_values, new_values];
        
   	end
   	
   	while(convergence criterion):
   		[new_values] = drying_plate_iteration[old_values];
   	end
   	
   	for(till the end of Drying chamber)
   	
   	    while(convergence criterion):
    		[new_values] = chamber_iteration[old_values];
    	end
        
        [pressure profile] = pressure_calc[old_values, new_values];
        
   	end
   	
   	chamber_data -> External_data_base;
   	
   	% Chimney Iteration
   	
   	Similar to the collector iteration with different dimensions;
   	
end
   	
   	% Now the values are stored in external data_base
   	
```



### Insights from the presentation

- The variation with experimental data is very high - specially during the day time
    - This might be the effect of neglecting thermal inertia of the dryer materials
    - This could also be related to the velocity change with change in solar radiation and temperature
      1. Only way to identify the issue is with finishing the complete code  - Pressure module at least
    
- Thermal inertia of the dryer could be built with introducing heat capacities in different material
- Also the glazing could be made a heat absorbing surface (This will change the dynamics of the heat loss losses)



### Important remaining work

1. Make the solar radiation module for different segments of dryer - (Prof. Nayak book would be helpful)
2. Generating valuable data from the model and compare it with the  experimental data
3. Generate few important PCM orientations
